/* 
TESTS for: 1. A capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
*/

/* 
TDD STEPS:
1. Write a test (bare bone test)
2. Write code to pass the test (bare bone code, not efficient, not optimized, just write code to pass the test)
3. If tests passes - refactor code; If test fails - go back to step 2
